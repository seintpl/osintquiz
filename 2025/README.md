# OSINT puzzles from Hotelrooms and other strange places - 2025 spring special edition

### Welcome to the SEINT 2025 quick spring quiz!

In this repository you will find a password-protected archive of this task's badge. This quiz has only one task!

To unlock the badge, make the MD5 hash of the answer, which consists of these words:
* what city is this? Take the first 3 characters from its name.
* how are these cities connected? what are they to each other? Take the first word from the two that describe their relationship.
* what are the people waiting for in this exact place? Take the first of the two words.
* what is the approximate hour this photo was taken? Take 2 digits of the approximate hour.

These words combined together, like in this pattern: aaabbbbbbcccccdd, turned into an MD5 hash, will unlock the badge.

For making the MD5 hash of the password, use only small Latin letters (and numbers or other characters if necessary).

For example, if the answer is "The White Rabbit", you have to make an MD5 hash of "the white rabbit" (without quotes), which in this case is 3431c695575ec664aebd5490fc1756b5. Use that hash to unlock the next level and see how deep does the rabbit hole go.
For MD5 hashes, you can use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=MD5()) or [this tool](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/md5.html) or any other one.

Have fun!

To start, just use the hash of the word "start" (without quotes) to uncover the first level task.
